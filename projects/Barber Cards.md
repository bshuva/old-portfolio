# Overview
As a part of the semiotics module of one week, I created a deck of cards where one can test another person's basic knowledge about the process involved in a cycle of cutting hair. The cards are gamified to make them exciting and challenging. In the game, one person tests another person's knowledge by using scenario red cards to side-track the person by distracting them from arranging them in the correct order. The green tackle cards are provided to the user in the beginning, to get over the created scenarios. 

These cards were designed for a particular targeted audience but can also be used for educational purposes.

# Conclusion
For this project, in-depth research has been done on barber shops. As India is a diverse country, there are different status of barber shops are available. From a small one-person business to a branded multi-room business, these cards are specifically made for the upper-tear businesses considering they will be more likely to spend on these cards. Processes and tools used in the projects are identified through interviews and observations. Though different approaches might be used by individual barbers based on personal choice, these cards give a fair idea of every step that should be involved in cutting of hair.
