Introducing design to high school students makes it one of the best ways to do so, as it makes students open-minded, exploratory, and critical thinkers.\nProviding them with a tool to understand their surroundings and culture, this project tries to create awareness about design thinking among students. It can also play a significant role in finding appropriate solutions to local problems.\nIn this attempt, the discussed solution also makes the learning of the design process in harmony with the science concepts such that it doesn’t feel like an extra effort added to their already existing course work. The solution is build considering the affordability and accessibility for an Indian middle-class family.</p>\n<h1 id=\"understanding-context-and-syllabus\"><a href=\"#understanding-context-and-syllabus\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Understanding context and syllabus</h1>\n<p>Certain aspects of design education must be included, like- ways of evaluation, exploration of new skills, hands-on experience, and an increase in understanding of surrounding designed object. This project aims to target majorly 8th standard students and their needs. As in the 8th standard, science is further divided into physics, chemistry, and biology, hence providing segregation to the complex topics. </p>\n<p>Following are the identified topics of science and Mathematics of the 8th standard that can be introduced in provided solution as their application can be observed in simple day to day life objects: <em>Visualising solids</em> (Front, side and top view), <em>Mapping spaces</em>, <em>Area</em>, <em>2d/3d</em> (Volume), <em>Intro to the graph</em>, <em>Basic probability and charts</em>, <em>Practical geometry</em>, <em>Simple interest and compound interest/tax</em>, <em>Basic concept of light</em>, <em>Material</em>\n(plastics, non-metal/metal), <em>Electric Current and its effects</em>.</p>\n<p>Understanding the vastness of design education basics like- <em>aesthetics, design process, and understanding of different prototyping tools</em>. The solution constrains only the \"Introduction of the design and design process\". The aim is that students have a better understanding of the design and use the design process by themselves. </p>\n<h1 id=\"concept-explorations\"><a href=\"#concept-explorations\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Concept explorations</h1>\n<p>After research, I realized that the solutions should explore different platforms and media. Getting used to or understanding the medium of the solution itself should not become a challenge. Hence platforms that are familiar to the target audience should be considered. </p>\n<h3 id=\"1-design-challenge-app\"><a href=\"#1-design-challenge-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>1.

It breaks down the design process into further smaller day-to-day steps and presents them as challenges. </p>\n<h3 id=\"2-design-case-studies-app\"><a href=\"#2-design-case-studies-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>2.

It enables users to understand real-life design problem solutions. Here they learn to understand the thinking behind a designed object and its cultural and social importance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-science-exhibition-video\"><a href=\"#3-science-exhibition-video\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>3.

The video explains the whole process through (making a paper boat) an example of making it. This solution tries to target students' interests and makes it a strategy to help them do a project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-re-design-app\"><a href=\"#4-re-design-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>4.

aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Concept evaluation</h1>\n<p>The concepts were taken to the users for their feed back and been compared with the assumtion made about the concepts and there limitations.\nIt was observed that most of the users were interested in the fact that they will be learning and even coming up with new designs by doing something they mostly do for fun.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 936 611' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'

It completed its primary goal to broaden the perspective about design among students and introduce the design process among them. It also increases the sensitivity of\nstudents towards the details in an everyday object.\nThough the introduced application is in its early stage, it has a lot of potentials, and through\nthe involvement of different activities, other parts of design education like understanding of aesthetics, material study, etc\ncan be included.\n<br>\nThe solution introduced is one of a kind, but it still cannot be monetized, as lot of work is required to make it a complete\nproduct. But as we see, MHRD pushing for the design education in school and due to COVID months of lockdown, which has\nshown people the possibility of working and learning from home. It can leave a lasting impact on students and teachers. This\nproduct can play a significant role in later years to come for school going students.</p>\n<br>\n<p>To Know more about the project contact me through my email- 3shuvam1@gmail.com\n<br></p>\n<p><em>This project has been done as my final year project to access the full report <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j0jCqrKrT1TsAnnbERahqCacBvrmp2cP/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">click here</a>.</em></p>\n","categories":["Interaction Design","UX Design","Design Education"],"project_bg_color":"","project_fg_color":""}},"context":{}}
