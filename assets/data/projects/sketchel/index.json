It required us to look for location, characters, script, music, and compositions of shots we should have to showcase the product in use and bring together a good quality video to promote our product.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2 id=\"research\"><a href=\"#research\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Research</h2>\n<p>We started with the objective:<br></p>\n<p><strong>We want to help</strong> illustrators, painters, and artists <br>\n<strong>to</strong> arrange and carry their painting tools for short travels or as table-top<br>\n<strong>so that</strong> nothing comes between their creativity when they travel.</p>\n<p>After talking to artists who travel regularly, we came up with the following scope or design objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The product must have different compartments for tools.</li>\n<li>A portable product. </li>\n<li>Keep track of travel experiences. </li>\n<li>Inspire you to sketch and create. </li>\n<li>Stay awake with you all the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2 id=\"ideation\"><a href=\"#ideation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Ideation</h2>\n<p>After we had a list of users' requirements, we all sat together for rapid sketching for ideation.\nWe all thought of ideas individually by sketching as many ideas as possible, and based on collective voting, we chose one of the best ideas, which we thought was able to meet most of the requirements. Then drafted the selected idea with other details like dimensions, curves, and dynamic parts.</p>\n<div class=\"row\"; style=\" display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;height:50%;\n  padding: 2px;\">\n  <div class=\"column\"; style=\"  flex: 30.7%;\n  padding: 2px;\">\n    <img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/7d0cf571743995.5c23b448d2c50.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/59317a71743995.5c23b448d2879.jpg\">\n    \n  </div>\n  <div class=\"column\" ; style=\"  flex: 33.3%;\n  padding: 02px;\">\n    <img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/96194371743995.5c23b448d20fa.jpg\">\n    <img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/c6d54e71743995.5c23b448d3542.jpg\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"column\" ; style=\"  flex: 33.3%;\n  padding: 02px;\">\n <img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/be536271743995.5c23b448d24d7.jpg\">\n <img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/49944e71743995.5c23b448d1cad.jpg\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2 id=\"prototypes\"><a href=\"#prototypes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Prototypes</h2>\n<p>After finalizing the concept, we made rapid prototypes with modular compartments to see what works best and efficiently arrange the art materials.

It also allows the user to keep track of available tools, make a travel schedule and create a Travel log consisting of videos and pictures. The stable platform also works as a battery-powered led lamp, like an animator's light box, which is controlled by the mobile app. </p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3 id=\"night-mode\"><a href=\"#night-mode\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Night-mode</h3>\n<img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/6b170671743995.62bb07713ec7a.gif\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"information-architecture-and-high-fedility-prototype\"><a href=\"#information-architecture-and-high-fedility-prototype\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Information Architecture And High-fedility Prototype</h3>\n<img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/cddbd671743995.5c23b44a29e1b.png\" width=\"65%\" height=\"65%\">\n<iframe src=\"https://marvelapp.com/prototype/68g4j76?emb=1&iosapp=false&frameless=false\" width=\"200\" height=\"322.5\" allowTransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"-webkit-clip-path: inset(2px 2px); clip-path: inset(2px 2px)\"></iframe> \n<br>\n<br>\n<h1 id=\"bts\"><a href=\"#bts\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>BTS</h1>\n<p>Sketchel is a creation of a collaboration between my friends Archa Suresh, Subha Govindaraj, Thadhagath MP, and me, where each of us played an essential part in realizing the product from a concept to a physical prototype. It took a lot of effort for each of us as we all had to use different new skills, which made it more fun. Although this project was a second-year project, it played a pivotal role and made us realize the potential of teamwork. *We divided the project into four parts: Research led by Subha Govindaraj, ideation and fabrication led by Aarcha Suresh, mobile integration by Shuvam Bharti, and Promotion video led by Thadhagath MP.</p>\n<img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/0e995071743995.5c23b68417888.jpg\" alt=\"team for shoot location hunt\" width=\"33%\">\n<img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/bbe67b71743995.5c23b684174f7.jpg\" width=\"33%\">\n<img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/3d4ae271743995.62af28bfb47bd.jpg\" width=\"33%\">\n","categories":["Product Design","Interaction Design","Product Promotion"],"project_bg_color":"","project_fg_color":""}},"context":{}}
